Useful Perl Scripts.

pcraw.pl 
--------
A web crawler in Perl. Stores crawled files locally. Keeps a log file. Useful for downloading a website.
This has become an independent project <a href="https://github.com/chenx/PCraw">PCraw</a> since 7/24/2014. New updates will go there.

phttp.pl
--------
A HTTP web server in Perl. Runs as a daemon. Default port is 9000. So you can visit http://localhost:9000 after it starts. Similar to Apache in function, serve static content. Should be easy to extend to handle dynamic content, e.g., work with Tomcat, php/jsp/asp/asp.net etc.

plog.pl
-------
A perl utility to count number of lines in all files with given suffix(es) in a directory and sub-directories recursively.
